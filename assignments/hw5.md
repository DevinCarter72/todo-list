# Week 5 HW - Strings and Arrays

1. Giving the following `Array`: `['My', 'JS', 'instructor', 'is', 'too', 'tough', 'on', 'me.']` - create a sentence as a `string`. You will want to use [`join()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join#Examples). Assign that to a variable, such as: `myStr`. _(3 pts.)_

2. Using [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) and `console.log()`, out put the total length of the completed sentence. _Hint:_ We are not using the browser or any DOM elements. So, you can jump straight to just 'getting' the `length`. _(2 pts.)_

3. Given the `Array`: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, _programmatically_ access each element of that array and use `console.log()` to output the sum of the elements. In other words, you will be logging: _15._ But, you need to show how to access each element manually and then, `+` it. This will be a bit tedious as we have not yet learned the idiomatic way to do this. We will next week. For now, do your best, and any genuine effort will be rewarded with _(2 pts.)._

4. Just recreate your own version of what I do in the long demonstration video - the last video for this week. _(3 pts.)_
