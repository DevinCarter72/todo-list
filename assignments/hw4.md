# Week 4 HW - Variables and Strings

Paste any text you want into index.html. Put it in a `<p id="text"></p>` _(1 pt.)_

Add another tag in your HTML like so: `<p id="character-count">Insert Character Length Here</p>`. You may add a class and some styling if you would like. _(1 pt.)_

Using `document.querySelector('#character-count')` grab that element and assign it to a variable. Be mindful of whether you will lose `const` or `let.` If you have installed the VS Code Extensions, then that should help quite a bit. _(2 pts.)_

Update the `innerText` property (use a 'setter') of `#character-count` to reflect the `length` property of whatever string you used inside `#text`. _(3 pts.)_

Don't forget to actually post your answers to the questions from the Slack workspace for this week.

And, of course, don't forget to `git push` your work back to your private HW repo so that I can actually see it.
